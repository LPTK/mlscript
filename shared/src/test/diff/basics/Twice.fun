let twice f x = f / f x
//│ twice: ('a -> 'b & 'c -> 'a) -> 'c -> 'b
// Note: the pretty-printed type of `twice` *used to be* simplified to ('a -> ('a & 'b)) -> 'a -> 'b
//    (another equivalent simplification is ('a | 'b -> 'a) -> 'b -> 'a);
//    this simplification lost some information in the context of first-class polymorphism
//    because function types effectively become non-mergeable without losing precsion...

let f = x => 1, x
//│ f: 'a -> (1, 'a,)

// Note: now that we instantiate during constraint solving instead of on variable reference,
//    we get the more useful type: 'a -> (1, (1, 'a,),).
//    Previously, we were getting: 'a -> ((1, 'c | 'b | 'a,) as 'b)
